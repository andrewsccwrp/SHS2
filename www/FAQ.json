	"title": "Why is the study being done?",
	"content": "State, local and federal regulatory agencies are interested in determining if there are any links between marine water exposure during the winter, infectious illness, and beach water quality. They are also interested in finding ways to more quickly and accurately determine if there is a health risk to beachgoers due to pathogens in the water. State and local governments have made great strides to improve water quality during the summer months (April - October) when the majority of beachgoers enter the ocean. However, there remains uncertainty about whether ocean exposure during the winter months, when water quality may be worse, poses a public health risk. This will be the first study to measure the health risks (if any) associated with surfing on the California coast. We hope that the information gained from the study will help inform watershed managers throughout San Diego and the rest of California to help guide investments in the management of storm water runoff.",

	"title": "Where and when will the study take place?",
	"content": " The study will enroll surfers through in-person outreach at Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surfing Park, and through web-based self-enrollment. The study will begin enrolling surfers in January 2014, and follow them with weekly surveys until May 2014. Surfers enrolled in the study may surf at beaches other than Ocean Beach and Tourmaline during the study period, but the study will focus its water quality testing at these two sentinel beaches.",

  {
	"title": "Why were these areas selected for this study?",
	"content": "San Diego County has some of the most heavily used beaches in the state of California during the winter months due in large part to its vibrant, year-round surfing community. The study decided to focus its in-person recruitment and water quality testing at Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surfing Park because they are located in San Diego County, they both attract a large, year-round surfing population, and they both have storm water discharges to the surf zone.",

	"content": "The quality of all recreational waters is routinely monitored to ensure swimmer and surfer safety. If a problem with water quality does arise, the public will be notified by the County Health Department of the problem as soon as possible. Advisory warnings and beach closure announcements will be posted at locations where water does not meet current quality standards.",

        "content": "The study will recruit and enroll surfers at Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surfing Park beginning in January 2014, and will also enroll surfers through a web portal advertised by the Surfrider Foundation and others. At enrollment, participants will complete a short series of questions about recent ocean exposure and illness. They will then complete similar surveys each week through a secure website or through secure smartphone apps (iPhone and Android) developed by the study. During the study period, water samples will be collected at different places along the sentinel beaches (Ocean Beach and Tourmaline). These samples will be analyzed for a number of traditional and new water quality indicators.",

If you are eligible, we will collect some contact information. When you leave the beach, we would like you to check in with one of our team members to answer a few short questions about your recent surf activity and illness. This should take about 10 minutes to complete. Finally, each week during the study we will send you either a text (SMS) or email reminder to complete a weekly survey that will ask about recent ocean exposure and illness symptoms. You will complete the follow-up surveys either on our secure website or through a secure smartphon app (iPhone or Android) developed by the study. Each weekly survey will take about 10 minutes. If, however, you are enrolling online, then you will need to complete a couple of eligibility questions, and review a consent form to see if you are eligible and willing to participate. If you are eligible, you will complete a short survey that should take 10-15 minutes. Finally, each week during the study we will send you either a text (SMS) or email reminder to complete a weekly survey that will ask about recent ocean exposure an illness symptoms.
